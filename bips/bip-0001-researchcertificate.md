## Purpose
Certifying that specific data or documents are generated, modified, analyzed, or processed at a specific time is valuable for the scientific community in order to protect intellectual property and incentivize data sharing. A common methodology for this is trusted timestamping which is used to ensure the creation and modification time of arbitrary data or a document. This requires a trusted authority to validate the data integrity by digitally signing upon receipt of a hash derived from the data. 

In addition, as the research process can be considered a workflow - there is a large benefit to include measurements of how data has changed through the research process, for instance between initial acquisition and then preprocessing. Thus, by concatenating multiple generated certificates, the workflow of a research process can be certified and validated at a later point in time.

Our aim is to standardize the research certificate with respect to what metadata should be included to identify the data, the process of research certificate generation, and the subsequent validation of an issued research certificate.
